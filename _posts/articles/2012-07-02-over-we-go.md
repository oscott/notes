# Jekyll

So hopefully this has worked, I should have a simple new workflow for posting notes about projects via [GitHub](http://github.com). Allowing me to update it via simple txt files and keeping everything to a minimum.

# Plan of content

The next step is to make some categories for the content and set up some letadata and tags for it all:

    Categories: Articles / Projects / About
    Articles:   Title / Body / Tags
    Projects:   Title / Description / Tags
    About:      Experience per top Tags
